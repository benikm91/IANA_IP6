# IANA - IMVS Autonomous Neural Assistant 

## Face Detection Validation

While developing IANA we made a tool that helps us to check our face detection component.
In the code you can turn on debug capabilities.
We used a similar method that FDDB used.

## Run

To run the validation go to the ```src/simulation``` folder and startup the program with the following command:
```python2 Validation.py```
